# Automated Air Purifier using ESP32, DHT22, and Blynk

## 📋 Project Overview

This project is a **smart air quality monitoring system** built using an **ESP32 microcontroller**, **DHT22 sensor**, **gas sensor simulation**, and **Blynk IoT platform**. It monitors environmental parameters like temperature, humidity, and gas levels and classifies the air quality. The data is displayed locally on an LCD and remotely through the Blynk mobile app. An LED is also used to alert users if air quality is bad.

## 🧰 Components Used

| Component          | Description                                 |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| ESP32              | Microcontroller with built-in Wi-Fi        |
| DHT22 Sensor       | Measures temperature and humidity           |

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Sensors Read Data**  
   - DHT22 reads temperature and humidity.
   - Potentiometer simulates gas sensor values (can be replaced with MQ sensors).

2. **Data Analysis**  
   - Air level is determined by temperature and humidity.
   - Gas level is derived from analog input.
   - Air quality is categorized as `Good` or `Bad`.

3. **Outputs**  
   - **LCD Display**: Cycles through readings and status.
   - **LED Alert**: Turns on if air quality is bad.
   - **Blynk App**: Shows data remotely via virtual pins.

## 📱 Blynk Integration

- **Virtual Pins**  
  - V1: Temperature (°C)  
  - V2: Humidity (%)  
  - V3: Gas Value

- Connect to Blynk using:
  - `BLYNK_TEMPLATE_ID`
  - `BLYNK_TEMPLATE_NAME`
  - `BLYNK_AUTH_TOKEN`

## 🧠 Air Quality Logic

### Air Level (Temp & Humidity):
| Temperature (°C) | Humidity (%) | Level  |
|------------------|--------------|--------|
| 22–30            | 30–60        | Good   |
| 30–40            | 60–70        | Normal |
| Others           | Others       | Bad    |

### Gas Level:
| Analog Value | Level  |
|--------------|--------|
| 0–1364       | Good   |
| 1365–2730    | Normal |
| 2731+        | Bad    |

### Final Air Quality:
- If **Air** and **Gas** are *Good or Normal*: `Good Air Quality`
- Else: `Bad Air Quality`
